# 1.Creating LVM

Here are the steps to create an LVM partition on an Ubuntu 20.04 server:

1. Check for existing LVM configuration:

```bash
pvs
```

2. Create physical volume on disk partition:

```bash
pvcreate /dev/sdb1
```

3. Create volume group:

```bash
vgcreate myvg /dev/sdb1
```

4. Create logical volume:

```bash
lvcreate -n lv1 -L 5G myvg
```

5. Format logical volume:

```bash
mkfs.ext4 /dev/myvg/lv1
```

6. Mount logical volume:

```bash
mkdir /mnt/lv1
mount /dev/myvg/lv1 /mnt/lv1
```

7. Edit `fstab` to automount on reboot:

```bash
echo "/dev/myvg/lv1 /mnt/lv1 ext4 defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
```

8. Extend logical volume size:

```bash
lvextend -L +2G /dev/myvg/lv1
resize2fs /dev/myvg/lv1
```

9. Reduce logical volume size:

```bash
lvreduce -L -1G /dev/myvg/lv1
```

10. Remove logical volume:

```bash
lvremove /dev/myvg/lv1
```

# 2. Removing LVM

Here are the steps to delete an LVM partition on Ubuntu:

1. Unmount the logical volume:

```bash
umount /mount/point
```

2. Remove the logical volume:

```bash
lvremove /dev/vg_name/lv_name
```

3. Remove the empty volume group:

```bash
vgremove vg_name 
```

4. Remove the physical volume:

```bash
pvremove /dev/sdX
```

For example:

```bash
# Unmount LV
umount /mnt/mylv

# Remove LV 
lvremove /dev/vg1/mylv

# Remove empty VG
vgremove vg1

# Remove PV 
pvremove /dev/sdb1
```

5. Alternatively, to remove everything in one go:

```bash
vgchange -an
pvremove /dev/sdX 
```

6. Update `fstab` to remove LV mount point:

```bash
vim /etc/fstab
```

7. Verify LV is removed:
```bash
pvdisplay
vgdisplay
lvdisplay
```

In step 2 of deleting the LVM partition, this:

```bash
lvremove /dev/vg_name/lv_name
```

`vg_name` and `lv_name` refer to:

`vg_name` = Volume Group name

When you create a volume group using the `vgcreate` command, it gives the volume group a name.

For example if you did:

```bash
vgcreate myvg /dev/sdb1
```

The `vg_name` would be `'myvg'`

`lv_name` = Logical Volume name

When you create logical volumes within a volume group using `lvcreate`, it gives each logical volume a name.

For example if you did:

```bash
lvcreate -n mylv -L 5G myvg
```

The `lv_name` would be `'mylv'`

So in the `lvremove` command, `vg_name` and `lv_nam`e identify the specific logical volume to remove by its volume group and name.

This ensures the correct logical volume is deleted, rather than accidentally removing the wrong one.

___

# 3. List all the logical volumes within a volume group

you can list all the logical volumes within a volume group using the `lvdisplay` command.

To list all LVs in a specific VG, you use:

```bash
lvdisplay <vg_name>
```

For example, to list all LVs in the volume group called `'myvg'`:

```bash
lvdisplay myvg
```

This will output information about each logical volume, including its name, size, permissions etc.

You can also use `lvdisplay` without specifying the VG to view all LVs across all VGs:

```bash
lvdisplay
```

A few other useful LVM listing commands:

- `vgdisplay` - List all volume groups
- `pvdisplay` - List all physical volumes
- `pvs` - List physical volumes briefly
- `vgs` - List volume groups briefly
- `lvs` - List logical volumes briefly

So in summary, to list just the names of logical volumes within a specific volume group, use:
```bash
lvdisplay <vg_name>
```

This is useful for identifying LVs when removing, modifying or getting details on them.

# 4. Decreasing LVM Size of Partitions
Here are the steps to decrease the size of an LVM logical volume partition:

1. Check the current LV size:
```bash
lvdisplay
```

2. resize2fs filesystem to match new size:

```bash
resize2fs /dev/vg_name/lv_name NEW_SIZE
```

3. Reduce logical volume size:

```bash
lvreduce -L -SIZE /dev/vg_name/lv_name 
```

For example:

```bash
lvreduce -L -2G /dev/vg1/lv1
```

This reduces lv1 size by 2G.

4. Verify new size:

```bash
lvdisplay /dev/vg_name/lv_name
```

A few important points:
- NEW_SIZE must be smaller than current size
- Unmount LV before resizing if its mounted
- Data on remaining space is preserved
- Size can only be reduced, not expanded this way
- Filesystem needs resizing before LV resize

So in summary:
1. `resize2fs`
2. `lvreduce`
3. Verify new size

# 5. Converting an existing Linux file system to LVM

it is possible to convert an existing Linux file system to LVM. Here are the steps:

1. Back up important data
    
2. Shrink the file system to leave unallocated space:
   
```bash
resize2fs /dev/sda1 30G
```

3. Create a physical volume from the unused space:

```bash
pvcreate /dev/sda1
```

4. Create a volume group using remaining space:

```bash
vgcreate vg_name /dev/sda1 
```

5. Create logical volume same size as original filesystem:

```bash
lvcreate -n lv_name -L 30G vg_name
```

6. Format and mount LV:

```bash
mkfs.ext4 /dev/vg_name/lv_name
mount /dev/vg_name/lv_name /mnt 
```

7.  over data from old filesystem:

```bash
cp -ax /original/fs/* /mnt
```

8. Update  `/etc/fstab`:

```bash
/dev/vg_name/lv_name /original/fs ext4 defaults 0 0
```

9. Mount new LV, verify data
    
10. Remove old filesystem:
    
```bash
umount /original/fs
```

So in summary:

1. Shrink filesystem
2. Create PV
3. Create VG
4. Create LV
5.  data
6. Update `fstab`

# 6. Convert an existing Linux file system to LVM

### prompt (Claude) : How can I Convert an existing Linux file system to LVM ? Please give me the steps with codes for each step

- Install LVM if it is not already installed:
   
```bash
sudo apt install lvm2
```

- Use `fdisk` to create a new partition on the disk you want to convert. Set the type to Linux LVM (type 8e):

```bash
sudo fdisk /dev/sdX
```

- Create a physical volume on the new partition:

```bash
sudo pvcreate /dev/sdX1
```

- Create a volume group and add the physical volume to it:

```bash
sudo vgcreate myvg /dev/sdX1
```

- Create a logical volume inside the volume group. This will be your new LVM logical volume:

```bash
sudo lvcreate -n mylv -L size myvg
```

- Format the new logical volume with a file system:

```bash
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/myvg/mylv
```

- Mount the new LVM logical volume somewhere:

```bash
sudo mount /dev/myvg/mylv /mnt
```

- Copy the data from the existing file system to the LVM logical volume:

```bash
sudo cp -a /source/. /mnt
```

- Update `/etc/fstab` to mount the LVM logical volume at boot.

- Reboot and ensure the system boots and mounts the LVM volume correctly.

### Prompt (Claude) : How can I Convert an existing Linux file system to LVM without loosing my data ? Please give me the steps with codes for each step.

To convert an existing Linux file system to LVM without losing data, the key steps are:

- Install LVM if not already installed:

```bash
sudo apt install lvm2
```

- Use `fdisk` to shrink the existing file system partition and create new partition for LVM:

```bash
sudo fdisk /dev/sda
```

- Create physical volume on the new partition:

```bash
sudo pvcreate /dev/sda5
```

- Create volume group and add physical volume to it:

```bash
sudo vgcreate myvg /dev/sda5
```

- Create logical volume with same size as existing file system:

```bash
sudo lvcreate -n mylv -L 100G myvg
```

- Format the logical volume:

```bash
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/myvg/mylv
```

- Mount the new logical volume:

```bash
sudo mount /dev/myvg/mylv /mnt
```

- Use `rsync` to copy data from old file system to new LVM logical volume:

```bash
sudo rsync -avx /old/filesystem /mnt
```

- Update `/etc/fstab` to mount new LVM volume at boot.

- Reboot and verify filesystem mounts correctly.

- 11. If all looks good, wipe the old partition.

The key is resizing the existing partition non-destructively, creating the LVM on new partition, copying data over, and verifying before wiping old filesystem.
